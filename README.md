## üß™ Test Cases Explained

This project includes 5 main test cases executed automatically when running the `Main` class. Each test simulates a different real-world scenario in the e-commerce system.

  - 2 units of ScratchCard (non-expirable product)  
- **Purpose:**  
  Verify normal checkout with valid items and sufficient balance.  
- **Expected outcome:**  
  Products are correctly listed, shipping fees calculated, and remaining balance updated.
